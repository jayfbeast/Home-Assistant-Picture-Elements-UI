# Home Assistant - Basic UI made of Picture Elements

Hello Home Assistant enthousiasts! 

After spending some time learning how HA, its components and Lovelace work... I decided to customize my Lovelace setup.

Right in the middle, I've decided to switch my UI for a much more sleek design. 

Since I've asked several questions in the Forum, I wanted to show my project even though it is not completed just for the sake of maybe inspiring others with their project.

Nothing wonderful in there... Several Picture element images have been taken from Google Image while all the graphic work has been done with GIMP. Both the layer file I've created along with the original image file are in the repository. You may reuse it!

### Security (Alarm)
My Alarm board is an ELK M1-Gold. When a zone is triggered (either with motion or opening a door), the violated zone will show in yellow.

### Basic Weather
Very basic weather. I had in mind to add a map, but for now, it won't happen in that version of the UI.
